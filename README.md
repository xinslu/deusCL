# DeusCL

I am starting this project as a complete beginner to Lisp, Interpreters/REPL and Rust in general. Through the project I hope to have a deeper dive into what a REPL is and what exatly goes into buildng a Lisp implementation. Because, of the research I have to do for this project I expect it to last for my entire semester, but only my commit history can tell how far down I will go with this project. I also have a research folder where I hope to detail all my notes in this process, maybe it might help me as I take my coding journey into the world of lisp.

# Structure of this Project

This readme and the project is general is living right now until maybe I decide to give up on it, but until then I will keep working on it. All the readmes within this project are living and I will keep on updating them as I summarize my findings and results.
